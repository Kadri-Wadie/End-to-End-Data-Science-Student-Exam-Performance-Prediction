In the context of the student performance prediction project and the provided app code, the artifacts folder typically serves as a centralized storage location for machine learning pipeline outputs required for predictions.

Why It Matters?
1- Reproducibility
Ensures the Flask app uses the exact same model/preprocessor as during training.

2- Deployment Safety
Isolates critical files from accidental modification (e.g., during Git operations).

3- CI/CD Integration
The .github workflows likely package this folder during deployment to platforms like AWS/Heroku.

4- Versioning
Often paired with tools like DVC or MLflow to track model iterations.
